# Travel.Website

For developing this website I used ASP.NET CORE MVC C#
In this project i tried to reach 2 main things: creating roles and user, creating posts
- Posts
- Accounts (Every account has one role: Administrator/Uploader/Normal)

Administrator: Can upload posts and edit profiles (deleting,changing roles)
Uploader: Can only upload posts
Normal: No roles
